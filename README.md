# Yello-calendar-scheduler
We spend too long in procrastination mode, wasting countless hours which could otherwise be spent productively towards our futures. The psychological barrier hindering task completion can be easily overcome with an alternative approach to being productive. This is where I introduce Yello - your friendly focus companion. Yello automatically finds the next focus period around your events so you spend 0 cognitive effort making a study timetable. Hardworking just like you, Yello is keen to study by your side and will remind you to stay on task when you drift off. Using AI, it learns when you study best and in what environments to recommend optimal study patterns. [Don't work solo? Focus with other's mascots...]
